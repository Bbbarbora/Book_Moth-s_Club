                Congrats, you’ve subscribed to our newsletter—what a feat! <br>
                But don’t worry, dear book-eater, there’s nothing to read or eat. <br>
                No cluttered inbox, no spammy tales, no endless stream of emails. <br>
                This was just a test, a project-y jest—no newsletters will fly your way. <br>
                So rest easy, fellow Book Moth, and flutter on with your day!
