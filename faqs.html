                    <p class="faq__answer">
                    Haha, absolutely not! We’re all about devouring books with our minds, not our mouths. Though, if you spot a few nibbled corners, it’s probably our pets getting curious. 😅</p>

                    <p class="faq__answer">Of course! We’d never judge—especially not when our shelves are arranged by cover color. We’re all about aesthetics and good vibes. ❤️📚</p>

                    <summary class="faq__question">Can I bring my favorite book if it’s falling apart?</summary>
                    <p class="faq__answer">Absolutely! We consider cracked spines, dog-eared pages, and taped-up covers as proof of a book well-loved. Bring it along—it’s got character, just like you!</p>

                    <p class="faq__answer">Sure, we’re modern moths! Though occasionally, we might try to swipe a paperback like it’s a touchscreen. (Spoiler: It doesn’t work.)</p>

                    <p class="faq__answer"> Absolutely! Whether you flutter through chapters or take your time savoring every word, we don’t speed-read shame. Think of yourself as a literary caterpillar—slow, steady, and destined to become a full-fledged Book Moth.</p>
