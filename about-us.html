          <p class="about-us__text"> We‚Äôre a quirky community of book lovers who just can‚Äôt get enough‚Äîliterally. Like our namesake, we devour books, page by page...though we promise we‚Äôre reading, not actually eating them!</p>
          <p class="about-us__text">Whether you‚Äôre a lifelong bookworm or a curious newbie, you‚Äôll find a cozy spot here. Join us to explore new reads, swap recommendations, and enjoy a good laugh (and maybe a nibble!) with fellow ‚Äúbook moths.‚Äù
          Ready to flutter into your next favorite story?.</p>

          <h2 class="about-us__title">History:</h2>
          <p class="about-us__text"> Legend has it that our book club was born on a dark and stormy night when a particularly ambitious worm named Wally decided to take a bite out of the latest bestseller. As Wally munched away, he inadvertently sparked a revolution among fellow book lovers who were tired of their beloved tomes being turned into moth snacks. Thus, our club was formed‚Äîa sanctuary for readers seeking refuge from the perils of the literary food chain! We gather to discuss books, share snacks (that are definitely not made of paper), and plot ways to keep our shelves safe from any potential infestations.</p>
